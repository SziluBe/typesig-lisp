# typesig-lisp

A simple lisp interpreter.

- variable bindings :white_check_mark:
- steppable evaluation :white_check_mark:
- lambda functions :white_check_mark:
- Y combinator and factorial function implemented in typesig-lisp :white_check_mark:
- basic list functions :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The .lisp files in this repo currently have a mix of notation, might implement loading source files later, at which point they will be cleaned up.

The 'scratch' file is included for fun, getting lambdas working quite right took me a second.
